# Smarter Dev

**Making developers smarter through practice, challenge, and community.**

## Who We Are

Smarter Dev is a practice-focused developer community where programmers at every level push their boundaries and grow together. Born from Beginner.Codes and evolved to serve developers across the entire skill spectrum, we believe that real learning happens when you write code, make mistakes, and tackle challenges alongside others doing the same.

## Our Philosophy

### Practice Over Tutorials
We believe writing code matters more than watching videos. Getting your hands dirty matters more than reading documentation. Making mistakes and learning from them matters more than getting it right the first time.

### Growth Through Challenge
Comfort zones are where skills stagnate. We design experiences that push boundaries—from 48-hour Squad Wars where teams compete together, to challenges that break beyond traditional coding problems. These aren't just competitions; they're catalysts for breakthrough moments in understanding and capability.

### Community as Curriculum
The best learning happens when developers of all levels work toward common goals. When a beginner and an expert tackle the same challenge together, both grow—one in skill, the other in perspective and teaching ability. The community becomes the curriculum, constantly evolving based on what members need and what the industry demands.

## What We Do

**Squad Wars**: Team-based coding competitions where squads face challenges together, building bonds and learning different approaches to problem-solving.

**Collaborative Learning**: A supportive environment where senior developers mentor juniors not from a pedestal, but from alongside them in the trenches.

**Gamified Engagement**: Our bytes system rewards consistent participation, creating a culture where showing up and contributing matters more than seniority.

## Why It Matters

In a world where AI is rapidly reshaping software development, the developers who will succeed aren't those who memorized the most syntax or completed the most tutorials. They're the ones who can think critically, solve novel problems, collaborate effectively, and adapt quickly. Everything we do is designed to build these meta-skills through deliberate practice and collaborative problem-solving.

*Making devs smarter isn't about teaching them what to think—it's about creating the environment where they learn how to grow.*
